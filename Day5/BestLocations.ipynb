    "### Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi, FlORence ici ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm a manager of AmazOR that wants to find the best possible locations for our warehouses while deciding how to allocate our client demands to these warehouses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our warehouses can only handle a limited amount of demand but we need to ensure that all client demands are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "While opening a new facility, we have some fixed costs, and we also take into account the cost of allocating the demand of each client to each warehouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we want to minimize our costs here...\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you help me solve this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "In instance.txt we can find an instance of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this problem is to minimize the cost of opening the warehouses and minimize the cost of allocate the demand of each client to each warehouse. Hence, the variables of our model will be the following:\n",
    "- $x_{ij}$, the units of client $i$ stored in warehouse $j$.\n",
    "- $y_{i}$, binary variable, $1$ if the warehouse $i$ is opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the objective function for our problem will be,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{minimize} \\sum_{i\\in\\text{n}_{\\text{W}}} C_{i}^{\\text{open}}y_{i} + \\sum_{i\\in\\text{n}_{\\text{W}}}\\sum_{j\\in\\text{n}_{\\text{C}}} C_{ij}^{\\text{client}}x_{ij}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $C_{i}^{\\text{open}}$ correspond the cost of opening warehouse $i$ and $C_{ij}^{\\text{client}}$ correspond the cost of handling the demand of client $j$ in warehouse $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constrains of maximum capacity of each warehouse and each client has satisfied his demand has to be implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the complete mathematical formulation for this problem is the following,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\text{maximize} & \\sum_{i\\in\\text{n}_{\\text{W}}} C_{i}^{\\text{open}}y_{i} + \\sum_{i\\in\\text{n}_{\\text{W}}}\\sum_{j\\in\\text{n}_{\\text{C}}} C_{ij}^{\\text{client}}x_{ij}\\\\\n",
    "\\text{subject to} & \\sum_{i\\in\\text{n}_{\\text{W}}} x_{ij} = D_{j} \\quad \\forall j\\in n_{C}\\\\\n",
    "& \\sum_{j\\in\\text{n}_{\\text{C}}} x_{ij} \\leq 5000 y_{i} \\quad \\forall i \\in n_{W}\\\\\n",
    "& x_{ij} \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall i,j \\\\\n",
    "& y_{i} \\in\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace \\quad \\forall i\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $D_{j}$ correspond the demand of client $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the problem is formulated, the next step is to solve it using Pyomo for the cost matrix $C^{\\text{open}}$, demand vector $D$ and the store cost $C^{\\text{client}}$ are available in `instance.txt`."
