# Advent Calendar on Operations Research

Advent calendars are a traditional way to celebrate the countdown to Christmas, with each day in December bringing a new surprise or task. 
This project is inspired by that tradition, but with a twist: an Advent calendar dedicated to solving interesting challenges and exploring concepts in **Operations Research**. 

This calendar is created by [Borja Men√©ndez Moreno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/borjamenendezmoreno/), where each day will include a new Operations Research task to solve.

In this repository I will upload my solutions to this impressive Advient Calendar.
